you sit with your feet in the water at your hotel's pool enjoying the florida heat

you had almost drown at a swimming lesson not too long ago, so you're not too keen on actually getting into the water, but there is a very cute boy who's family is also here on vacation swimming in the pool.

you find your deep-seated fear of water and your yet-to-be-realized homosexuality at odds with each other. you don't realize this yet, but you will understand this decades later

<> was so cool. he had travelled the world and spoke four languages. and you were sitting at but not in the water, because swimming was scary.

"come in!" he says while playfully splashing you.

memories of being a few inches shorter and desperately trying to kick off a bottom of a much larger pool to get to surface for one last breath bubble up, and you sit with them for a moment.

<> dives under the water and does a handstand, sticking his skinny legs straight up into the air

he falls ass forward, splashing you again.

"see! it's not too deep!"

you hadn't told <> you were scared of water like a little bitch. you were trying to play it cool, and it was not cool to be scared of swimming.

you'd spent the majority of your week hanging around <> because he was the only other boy around your age around. making friends is hard for you, but you connected with him intellectually and asked all about his travels. florida is the furthest you've ever travelled from home, but he had been to and lived in a dozen or so different *countries.* that he also had big, beautiful, dark eyes and perfect sunkissed skin are elements of this story you do not consciously understand yet.

in that moment, you made the decision to go talk to the smart boy in the pool.

doing this will unlock multiple quest lines later in your life, but all that you care about in the moment is being close to <>. you wanted to be in the pool with him, despite a pool being involved in your near death experience.

you take off your shirt and make your way to the pool's stairs. you hadn't been able to even sit in a bathtub for years. you're already confronting a fear by getting into the water -- you don't need to show off by jumping in.

<> seems to understand your apprehension and patiently waits for you.

you submerge yourself up to your chest

flashbacks of coughing up water while looking up a high ceiling
