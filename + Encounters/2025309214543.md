you sit on your thone, under the dim bask of a ringlight, listening to background Yu-Gi-Oh episodes, while his royal majesty, [[2025303131036|Mr. Tinkles]] cooks something that smells delicious

it is [[timeblock-date-Nov05|Nov 05]]th.

tonight you adventure into the [[2025303131346|Nullspire]] for fun and profit with your spirit guide Gengar assuming the Helm. Gengar is giving you the vibe that you should venture deep into your wizard's tower and descend in the [[layer-073|Wells of Darkness]] to re-explore the 2005 classic film, V for Vendetta

one does not simply enter the [[layer-073|Wells of Darkness]], as it is a place of infinite content and infinite distraction. you must traverse the [[layer-073|Wells of Darkness]] with purpose and intent.

you know that many of the portals into the [[2025303131346|Nullspire]] are sealed
