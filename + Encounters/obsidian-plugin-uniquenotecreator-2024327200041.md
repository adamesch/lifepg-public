This is a screenshot of the settings used for the [[obsidian-plugin-uniquenotecreator-2024327200041|Unique Note Creator]] plugin:

- newly created notes are saved to [[+ Encounters]]
- newly created notes are made from the [[template-uniquenote]] note (saved under Extras/Templates)
- the `YYYYDDDDHHmmss` unique prefix format results in newly created notes being prefixed with a 13-digit ID
	- `DDDD` is the moment.js token for day of the year (e.g. "123")
	- `DDDo` is the moment.js token for the ordinal day of the year (e.g. "123rd")
