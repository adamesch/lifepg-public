[[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] received an email with the subject

`How to Reset Your Digitial Life in 4 Steps`

![[screenshot-20241126103004.png]]

The email did not include 4 steps to reset anything but included some prompts for completing an annual review.

To address the prompt:

In the spring of [[timeblock-year-2022|2022]], [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] systematically eliminated every problem in his life, and that light feeling of not having anything to worry about -- even temporarily -- fueled a certain "aliveness."

To address the subject:

[[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] is defining æOSv5 for [[timeblock-year-2025|2025]], and one of the things he does near the end of every year is to reorganize his digital files **everywhere** to better serve him. æOSv5 will be a distributed system, so as of the end of [[timeblock-date-Nov25|Nov 25]], [[timeblock-year-2024|2024]], all of [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]]'s files have been moved up into the cloud.
