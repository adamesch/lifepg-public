# recap

- timeblocking is an advanced productivity technique used to visually structure **and** budget your available time
	- everything you need to do on a particular day should be scheduled in advance
	- tie specific routines to specific timeblocks
	- multitasking is a lie. whole ass one thing at a time.
- the key to timeblocking is actually following the schedule you set for yourself. don't timeblock a thing if you don't intend on actually doing it then.

# tips

- use multiple calendars to stay organized, and layer those calendars on top of each other using an app like [[app-fantastical-2024327092140|Fantastical]]
- if you're new to timeblocking, start by adding "sleep" as a calendar event and repeating it out to infinity. ideally, your sleep schedule should be the same **every day**. your body craves consistency.
	- continue by adding a "work" event on the days/hours you are committed to work
	- add smaller and more granular blocks to fill out the rest of your day
	- in addition to "sleep," don't forget to add other required human functions like eating, showering, etc
- structure your day around your energy levels. if you are a night owl, scheduling productive things in morning will only make your hate yourself.
- add a location to each timeblock to reinforce it being blocked -- the idea being that you go to a specific place to do a specific thing.
- optionally, use the notes section of calendar events as a todo list. there are better task management methods, but you do you.
