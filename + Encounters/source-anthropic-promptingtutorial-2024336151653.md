## Messages API

Calling the Messages API requires the following:

- `model`: the name of the model you intend to call
- `max_tokens`: the maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping
- `messages`: an array of alternating `user` and `assistant` messages
	- each message must be an object with a `role` and `content`
	- messages must start with a `user` turn
