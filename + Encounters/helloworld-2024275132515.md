Greetings, adventurer!

This Obsidian vault contains notes written by [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam Esch]], who claims to be a wizard of considerable power. This mind palace is known as the [[mansionoftherake|Mansion of the Rake]] and is anchored to various layers of the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]], the birthplace of demons.

You currently find yourself on [[layer-099]] of the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]], which is unnamed. All newly created notes enter the [[mansionoftherake|Mansion of the Rake]] automatically linked to [[layer-099]] and are saved to the `+ Encounters` folder (see the [[helloworld-2024275132515#The eACCESS System|eACCESS]] section below for more information regarding folders)

The [[Home]] note is your best bet for navigating this vault and the layers of the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]]. Consult it if you get lost.

Adam is cursed with [[ADHD]]. The [[monster-adhddæmon-2024325002507|ADHD Dæmon]] is generally unhelpful, but being a **demon**, he can guide you through the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]] if successfully bribed/commanded.

# The eACCESS System

[[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] implemented [[person-nickmilo-2024325012820|Nick Milo]]'s [[pkm-eaccess-2024325115416|eACCESS]] system after getting into PKM. Notes are physically organized with the [[pkm-eaccess-2024325115416|eACCESS]] system:

| folder name                                     | folder purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Extras                                          | documents, pictures, etc -- any file that **isn't** a note -- are imported to the `Extras` folder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Sources                                         | source notes are saved separately from the generic notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Special Interests.canvas\|Special Interests]] | project files -- including project notes -- are saved using a different folder structure that's reproduced everywhere [[person-adamesch-1989130030300\|Adam]] saves files. This structure is contained within the `Special Interests` folder for reasons (see the [[helloworld-2024275132515#The PARA System\|PARA]] section below) |

# The PARA System

Adam implemented [[person-tiagoforte-2024325013812|Tiago Forte]]'s [[pkm-para-2024325115507|PARA]] system within the [[Special Interests.canvas|Special Interests]] folder. [[pkm-para-2024325115507|PARA]] is similar to [[pkm-eaccess-2024325115416|eACCESS]], except it was the answer to a different question:

"How do I organize my notes" led [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] to [[pkm-eaccess-2024325115416|eACCESS]]

"How do I organize my files" led [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] to [[pkm-para-2024325115507|PARA]]

Notes **are** files within Obsidian, so instead of picking system, [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] chose to use both.

# WTF is Zettlekasten?

![[source-quote-elonmusk-2024325111648]]

^That^ is an [[person-elonmusk-2024325111801|Elon]] quote, and Zettlekasten is [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]]'s system for navigating the storm.

How it works isn't important. What is important is that tags are magical, and that organization is an emergent property of this vault.
