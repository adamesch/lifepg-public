Greetings, adventurer!

This Obsidian vault contains notes written by Adam Esch, who claims to be a wizard of considerable power. This mind palace is known as the [[mansionoftherake|Mansion of the Rake]] and is anchored to various layers of the Abyss.

You currently find yourself on [[layer-099]] of the Abyss, which is unnamed. All newly created notes enter the [[mansionoftherake|Mansion of the Rake]] automatically linked to [[layer-099]] and are saved to the `+ Encounters` folder.

The [[Home]] note is your best bet for navigating this vault and the layers of the Abyss. Consult it if you get lost.

Adam is cursed with [[ADHD]]. The [[monster-adhddæmon-2024325002507|ADHD Dæmon]] is generally unhelpful, but being a **demon**, he can guide you through the Abyss if successfully bribed/commanded.
