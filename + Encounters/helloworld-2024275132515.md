Greetings, adventurer!

This Obsidian vault contains notes written by [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam Esch]], who claims to be a wizard of considerable power. This mind palace is known as the [[mansionoftherake|Mansion of the Rake]] and is anchored to various layers of the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]], the birthplace of demons.

You currently find yourself on [[layer-099]] of the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]], which is unnamed. All newly created notes enter the [[mansionoftherake|Mansion of the Rake]] automatically linked to [[layer-099]] and are saved to the `+ Encounters` folder (see the [[helloworld-2024275132515#The eACCESS System|eACCESS]] section below for more information regarding folders)

The [[Home]] note is your best bet for navigating this vault and the layers of the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]]. Consult it if you get lost.

Adam is cursed with [[ADHD]]. The [[monster-adhddæmon-2024325002507|ADHD Dæmon]] is generally unhelpful, but being a **demon**, he can guide you through the [[location-abyss-2024325113505|Abyss]] if successfully bribed/commanded.

# The eACCESS System

Adam implemented [[person-nickmilo-2024325012820|Nick Milo]]'s eACCESS system after getting into PKM. Notes are physically organized with the eACCESS system:

| folder name                                     | folder purpose                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [[+ Encounters]]                                | newly created notes are saved here |

| Calendar                                        |                                    |

| Sources                                         |                                    |
| [[Special Interests.canvas\|Special Interests]] |                                    |


# The PARA System

# WTF is Zettlekasten?

![[source-quote-elonmusk-2024325111648]]


^That^ is an [[person-elonmusk-2024325111801|Elon]] quote, and Zettlekasten is [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]]'s system for navigating the storm.

How it works isn't important. What is important is that tags are magical, and that organization is an emergent property of the vault.
