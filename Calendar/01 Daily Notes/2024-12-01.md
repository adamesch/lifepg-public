# log

- [[person-adamesch-1989130030300|Adam]] installed the calendar and periodic notes plugins, and he created a new template for daily notes (see: [[template-dailynote]])

	- new notes contain a temporal navigation block based on the date the note was created with `âŒ˜N`. the temporal navigation block for periodic notes is based on the filename, which for daily notes is always YYYY-MM-DD
