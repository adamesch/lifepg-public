# Piri Reis Map

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Piri_reis_world_map_01.jpg/1280px-Piri_reis_world_map_01.jpg)

- document made at Constantinople in #history/1515 
- depicts Antarctica before Antartica was discovered in #history/1818 AND depicts it as ice-free
- implies source maps Piri Reis used were inherited from much older sources
	- the subglacial topography of the land beneath the ice has been hidden since 4000 BCE

# Charles Hapgood

- proposed that Antarctica was not always covered in ice and moved southward by a mechanism called "earth-crust displacement" #history/1953
